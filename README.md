## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

Use Case: When you need to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to that instance. Example: Database connection, Logger, Configuration settings.

Example: [Singleton](./src/design-patterns/creational/singleton-dp.ts)
